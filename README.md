Big Data Analytics for Predicting Air Quality in Smart Cities 🏙️🍃
📌 Project Overview
As urban populations grow, air pollution has become a critical challenge for Smart Cities. This project leverages Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning to monitor, analyze, and predict air quality levels in real-time. By integrating data from various urban sources, the project provides a predictive dashboard that empowers citizens and city planners to make data-driven health and environmental decisions.

🚀 Key Features
Real-time Dashboard: Interactive visualization of Air Quality Index (AQI) using Streamlit.

Predictive Modeling: Accurate 24/48-hour forecasts for PM2.5, PM10, and other toxic gases.

Data Integration: Aggregates heterogeneous data including weather variables (Temp, Humidity, Wind) and historical pollution levels.

Actionable Insights: Provides health advisories based on current and predicted pollution severity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis of seasonal trends and pollutant correlations.
